we create a falsehead and itr pointer moves over falsehead
head pointer moves over main list
if head = 0 and head.next!=0 then we create a new node in falsehead
if head != we add up the value i.e. itr value + head value  until head.next =0
we return falsehead.next because we have initialised the head node of falsehead = 0 but we need the sum values which starts from the next node
