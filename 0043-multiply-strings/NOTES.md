Facts You should know:
​
Product of two number of length n and m will be atmax of length n+m.
Eg : 9*9 =81 . Its a fact kind of thing needed for this question.
​
Product of digit at idx1 and idx2 will have effect only on idx1 + idx2 + 1(digit idx) and idx1 + idx2(remainder).
​
Boundary Cases:
​
If any of num is zero then Product is zero.
if one number is negative or second is Positive [here they have mentioned string consist digit only]
So no need to handle this boundary Case. But in Interview Clarify this from your Interviewer.Else you may get Rejection even after Solving Correctly.
