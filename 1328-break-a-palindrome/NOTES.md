s is a character array that stores the palindrome string
toCharArray(), creates a defensive copy of the original string and returns it to the caller function
the for loop runs from 0 to n/2
and check if s[i] != a,  then s[i] = a
​
By the help of string valueOf() method, you can convert int to string, long to string, boolean to string, character to string, float to string, double to string, object to string and char array to string
​
if s[i] = a then s[n-1] = b and returns " " if n<2 else returns String.valueof(s)
